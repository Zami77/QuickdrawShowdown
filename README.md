# QuickdrawShowdown
 A timed duel quick draw game made in Godot.
 
 Press Z or Spacebar to draw your weapon only when the game says draw! If you draw too early or too late, you'll lose the round. You can also hold down shift while you draw for a boost to your time, once per 3 round duel.
 You can also block by pressing X once per 3 round duel.
